# Goal
* Learn about
  * `let`
  * `match`
  * methods
  * associated functions
  * external crates
  * variables
  * reference
  * placeholder
  * Cargo.lock

## Variables
* `let variableName`
* By default, they are immutable

## Associated functions
* := function / implemented on a type
* `type::functionName`

## Reference / Pointer
* `& variableName`
* By default, they are immutable

## Placeholder
* `{VariableToEvaluate}` OR `{}, expression`

## Cargo.lock
* := mechanism which
  * if anyone builds the project â†’ rebuild the same artifact
  * is used rather than specified in Cargo.toml
