# Goal
* Learn about
  * `let`
  * `match`
  * methods
  * associated functions
  * external crates
  * variables
  * reference

## Variables

* By default, they are immutable

## Associated functions
* := function / implemented on a type
* `type::functionName`

## Reference / Pointer
* `& variableName`
* By default, they are immutable
