# Goal
* Learn about
  * `let`
  * `match`
  * `loop`
  * methods
  * associated functions
  * external crates
  * variables
  * reference
  * placeholder
  * Cargo.lock

## Variables
* `let variableName`
* By default, they are immutable

## Associated functions
* := function / implemented on a type
* `type::functionName`

## Reference / Pointer
* `& variableName`
* By default, they are immutable

## Placeholder
* `{VariableToEvaluate}` OR `{}, expression`

## Cargo.lock
* := mechanism which
  * if anyone builds the project → rebuild the same artifact
  * is used rather than specified in Cargo.toml

## Rust
* Strong & Static Type system + Type inference
* shadowing
  * == variable — can be — reused
    * Note: 👁️even change the type👁️

## Numbers
* `i32` is by default
* `u32`

# Notes
* All samples code are '/listings'
